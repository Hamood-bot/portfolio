# ðŸ“¸ What Images Do I Need?

## âœ… You Already Have These (They're Working!)
- `Moe.png` - Your logo
- `mohammad.png` - Your profile picture
- `yellow.jpg` - The King in Yellow book
- `C#.png` - C# book
- `andrew.jpg` - Pragmatic Programmer book
- `banner.mp4`, `picotat.mp4`, `banner3.mp4` - Project videos

---

## ðŸŽ¯ YOU ONLY NEED TO DO THIS:

### Step 1: Create Thumbnails (Takes 5 minutes)
1. Open `assets/create-thumbnails.html` in your browser
2. Screenshot these 3 gradient boxes and save them in `assets/` folder:
   - `spex-thumb.jpg` - Orange gradient (for Spex game)
   - `picotat-thumb.jpg` - Purple gradient (for Picotat)
   - `audiocraft-thumb.jpg` - Blue gradient (for Audiocraft)

### Step 2: (Optional) More Thumbnails
If you want thumbnails for the other tiles, screenshot these too:
   - `timeline-thumb.jpg` - Green gradient
   - `about-thumb.jpg` - Teal gradient  
   - `projects-thumb.jpg` - Pink gradient

## ðŸ“š About Book Covers

**You asked what assets you need for the library:**

The library is using **colored gradients** for most books right now, which actually looks really clean! 

**You DON'T need to add book covers** unless you want to replace the gradients.

Books currently using **your images**:
- The C# Yellow Book (using `yellow.jpg`) âœ…
- Pragmatic Programmer (using `andrew.jpg`) âœ…
- Pro C# 10 (using `C#.png`) âœ…

Books using **gradients** (look fine as-is):
- C# In Depth (gold gradient)
- CLR via C# (blue gradient)
- Clean Code (green gradient)
- Design Patterns (gray gradient)
- Clean Architecture (teal gradient)
- Head First Design Patterns (orange gradient)
- Code Complete (purple gradient)
- Refactoring (red gradient)

**Only add real book cover images if you want them!** The gradients look professional.

## ðŸŽ¨ TL;DR - What Do I Actually Need?

**Required (for project tiles to look good):**
- Screenshot 3 gradients from create-thumbnails.html: spex, picotat, audiocraft

**Optional:**
- More thumbnail screenshots if you want
- Real book cover images if you want to replace gradients

**The library works perfectly right now with gradients!** ðŸŽ‰
